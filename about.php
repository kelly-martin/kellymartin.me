    <h4>Where I've Been, What I've Done</h4>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. A city known for its
      <a href="http://cincinnatibrewinghistory.com/" target="_blank">beer history</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyline_Chili" target="_blank">unique chili</a>, and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeter%27s" target="_blank">Oprah-worthy ice cream</a>,
      Cincy's got a lot to offer. After spending the first 18 years
      of my life there, however, I was ready for a change. In 2012, I headed
      south for college, enticed by warm weather and football.
    </p>
    <p>
      I attended
      <a href="http://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=18441710" target="_blank">Clemson University</a>
      and graduated in May 2016 with a degree in Computer Information Systems
      (essentially, a combination of core Computer Science classes and electives in
      Management Information Systems). I completed a couple tech internships during
      my summers while at Clemson - one in the healthcare industry on the east coast,
      the other in aerospace on the west coast. These experiences gave me valuable
      insight into the kind of work I wanted to do as well as where I wanted to live.
    </p>

    <p>
      I accepted a job with a large telecommunications company during my senior
      year and moved to Denver, CO in July 2016. I worked at that company as a
      <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/roles/product-owner" target="_blank">product owner</a>
      for a little over a year. I had a lot of responsiblity, an awesome
      team environment, and worked on a lot of high-visibility projects. I feel very lucky
      and grateful to have had such a positive experience for my first full-time job
      after college. However, I was not entirely intrigued by the growth opportunities
      and the future paths available for a product owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew I wanted a change but I didn't know exactly what kind of change.
      So, in August 2017, I paid off the remainder of my student loans and left
      DISH to answer the age-old question: “What am I going to do with my life?”.
      Since then, I have traveled; I have taught myself a variety of web
      languages/frameworks and become passionate about full-stack web
      development; and, most importantly, I have developed a clearer understanding
      of what I find to be meaningful work. Currently, I am applying for jobs at
      tech companies in the Denver metro area. If you are an employer, feel free
      to <a href="skills">check out my skills</a> or <a href="portfolio">explore my portfolio</a>.
