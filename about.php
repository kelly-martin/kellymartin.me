    <h4>Where I've Been, What I've Done</h4>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. A city known for its
      <a href="http://cincinnatibrewinghistory.com/" target="_blank">beer history</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyline_Chili" target="_blank">unique chili</a>, and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeter%27s" target="_blank">Oprah-worthy ice cream</a>,
      Cincy's got a lot to offer. After spending the first 18 years
      of my life there, however, I was ready for a change. In 2012, I headed
      south for college, enticed by warm weather and football.
    </p>
    <p>
      I attended
      <a href="http://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=18441710" target="_blank">Clemson University</a>
      and graduated in May 2016 with a degree in Computer Information Systems
      (essentially, a combination of core Computer Science classes and electives in
      Management Information Systems). I completed a couple tech internships during
      my summers while at Clemson - one in the healthcare industry on the east coast,
      the other in aerospace on the west coast. These experiences gave me valuable
      insight into the kind of work I wanted to do as well as where I wanted to live.
    </p>

    <p>
      I accepted a job with a large telecommunications company during my senior
      year and moved to Denver, CO in July 2016. I worked at that company as a
      <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/roles/product-owner" target="_blank">product owner</a>
      for a little over a year. I had a lot of responsiblity, an awesome
      team environment, and worked on a lot of high-visibility projects. I feel very lucky
      and grateful to have had such a positive experience for my first full-time job
      after college. However, I was not entirely intrigued by the growth opportunities
      and the future paths available for a product owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew I wanted a change but I didn't know exactly what kind of change, and,
      at the time, I was rethinking almost all aspects of my life. So, in August
      2017, I paid off
      the remainder of my student loans, quit my job, and left the corporate
      world for a few months of traveling and determining what my next work endeavour
      would be. During that time, I enrolled in an online course on full-stack
      web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      In signing up for the course, I had merely intended to learn some new languages
      and brush up on my programming skills from undergrad, but <strong>I ended
      up falling in love with web dev.</strong> The satisfaction I got from
      building something visual and functional was a completely new feeling, one
      I had never experienced from work in the past. For the first time in my life,
      I felt like I was <em>truly creating</em>. Upon realizing my passion for web
      dev, I shirked all other hobbies/interests to focus on expanding my knowledge
      and increasing the caliber of my skills. The past few months have involved
      learning new languages and frameworks, mastering algorithms, and working on
      the projects in my portfolio. Currently, I am applying for full-stack web
      developer jobs at tech companies in the Denver metro area. If you are an
      employer, feel free to <a href="resume">check out my skills</a> or
